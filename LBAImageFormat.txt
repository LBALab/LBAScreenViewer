[#] [ INFORMATION ] ------------------------------------------------------------

This document describes the format in which the LBA1\Relentless and LBA2\Twinsen
Odyssey images are stored in. I used this information in the generation of my 
screen viewer.
If you find any errors in this document please email me the details, also if you
find new stuff please notify me. This information is provided AS IS.


[#] [ FORMAT ] -----------------------------------------------------------------

The LBA Image format is simply to load but have a particular thing that we have 
to look at.
If the image file size was:
	[-] 307200 then the image size is 640x480
	[-] 131884 then the image size is 512x256
	[-] 65536: then the image size is 256x256

Now that we know the image size we can get the image.
All bytes in the image files are colours index. (1 colour is made with 3 palette bytes - See palette format for more information)

The data start with lines. It repeats as many times as the height of image is.

[line]

The next data describes columns of specified line. It repeats as many times as the width of image is.

[column]

00:    byte   Colour index.

[/column]

[/line]
